# Notes for using the repository:
1) Initially, the repository containing all the files utilized for the test was cloned to the local computer - please check the 'terminal_log.rtf' for precise Git commands to clone test directory, set up a new local directory, make changes, commit and push them
2) The R_Scripts folder has two files - 'Answer_2.R' and 'Answer_3.R' corresponding to the script required to run the codes for the entire 2nd and 3rd excercises respectively. P.S. Please don't forget to change your working directory to the location where you have stored the raw data only while using 'Answer_2.R' as it uses the '2019 Zimbabwe MICS6' survey data
3) The 'Graphs_Tables' folder contains all the output tables and graphs (from the 'Answer_2.R' and 'Answer_3.R' scripts) inside the folders 'Response_2' and 'Response_3'
4) The folder 'Response_4' contains the brief summary of some of the results derived during the exercise
